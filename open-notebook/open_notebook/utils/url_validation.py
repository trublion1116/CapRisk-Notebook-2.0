"""
URL validation shared by the credentials API and the AI provisioning layer.

Lives in open_notebook.utils (not api/) so it can be imported both by the API
layer (credential create/update, source-URL ingestion) and by open_notebook's
own AI layer (connection_tester.py, ModelManager) to re-validate a
provider-configured URL immediately before it is actually used - closing most
of the DNS-rebinding TOCTOU window left by validating only once, at save time.

For outbound HTTP to user-supplied hostnames, prefer
``prepare_pinned_http_target``: it resolves DNS once, rejects dangerous
addresses, and returns a URL pinned to the vetted IP so httpx cannot
re-resolve to a metadata endpoint (while Host/SNI stay on the original host).

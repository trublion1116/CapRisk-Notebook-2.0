"""
Regression tests for issues #1044 and #630.

#1044: generate_podcast_command must honor the speaker_profile parameter
instead of always re-deriving the speaker from episode_profile.speaker_config.

#630: episode_profile.speaker_config references the speaker profile by
record ID (migration 20) instead of by name, so renaming a speaker profile
no longer breaks episode profiles. The command resolves either form via
SpeakerProfile.resolve, and the API boundary (PodcastService) resolves the
user-facing name to a record ID before submitting the job.

No database is available in tests: profile lookups are mocked. Command tests
let the command fail at a deterministic early exit (speaker not found) so the
assertion is purely about WHICH speaker profile reference was resolved.
